This is my first step into full web developement and deployment. this project that has finally been finished taught me a great many things including; why multiple programming langauges might
be used in one project, how a web application can be deployed in a cost effective way, the differences between a mobile application and a web application in the development process, 
it taught me more hard skills like JS,Node,React,Tailwind,HTML,CSS and even how JSON data interacts with a website.

This project was one that was both simultainously frustrating yet very rewarding to complete and finish, from trying to learn the langauges and how their syntax operates to managing pretty simple
command line version control that I had never done on a aproject before. I think this project has given me a lot more insight into how web developement works and how it operates and functions in 
a real world setting. 

For future adds, I want to add a way to customize each players name so that way at the table people don't need to figure out who is who for each player. the next thing in terms of more streamline
functionallity is figuring out a way to display each life total on the screen at the same time rather then needing to scroll on a mobile platform, although this I think will have some challenges
lastly for feature implementation and probably the last I will do because its really more quality of life rather then something that is essential for app functionality, is figuring out how to display
creature artworks in the specific player boxes, I think it would be just really neat
